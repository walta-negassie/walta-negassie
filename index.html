        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a highly motivated and ambitious Computer Science major at Augsburg University, maintaining a 3.83 GPA and driven by a passion for technology and software development. I bring strong problem-solving skills, a fast-learning mindset, and a collaborative approach to every project I undertake. Through my experience as a web development intern, I’ve built a solid foundation in coding and teamwork, and I’m eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges as a software engineer. With a well-rounded background in extracurricular leadership and community service, I’m ready to contribute meaningfully to an innovative and growth-oriented team.
